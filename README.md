Welcome to Polr's 2.0 development branch.
Please keep in mind 2.0 is pre-alpha, and should not be used in production. This version of Polr break existing 0.x and 1.x installations, but migrations will be provided.

Once 2.0 is complete, it will supercede the current stable version of Polr, but the latest 1.x version will continue to be available as a legacy release for users who cannot make the switch to 2.0 due to their host or do not meet the new server requirements.

Polr 2.0 moves away from `mysqli`, rather taking on `PDO` with `Eloquent`. Routing and autoloading will be done with `composer` and the Lumen web framework. Although unlikely, this change may cause those on shared hosting to be unable to install Polr.
