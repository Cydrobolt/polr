Welcome to Polr's 2.0 development branch.
Please keep in mind 2.0 is pre-alpha, and should not be used in production.

Polr is a beautiful, modern, lightweight, and minimalist open-source URL shortening application. It allows you to host your own URL shortener, to brand your URLs, and to gain control over your data. Polr is especially easy to use, and provides a modern, themable interface.
